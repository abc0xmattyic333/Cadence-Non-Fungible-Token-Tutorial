# Non-Fungible Token Tutorial
 An introduction to NFTs on Cadence
 In this tutorial, we're going to deploy, store, and transfer Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).

 The NFT is an integral part of blockchain technology. An NFT is a digital asset that represents ownership of a unique asset. NFTs are also indivisible, you can't trade part of an NFT. Possible examples of NFTs include: CryptoKitties, Top Shot Moments, and tickets to a really fun concert.

 To get you comfortable using NFTs, this tutorial will teach you to:

 1. Deploy the NFT contract and type definitions.
 2. Create an NFT object and store it in your account storage.
 3. Create an NFT collection object to store multiple NFTs in your account.
 4. Create an NFTMinter and use it to mint an NFT.
 5. Create references to your collection that others can use to send you tokens.
 6. Set up another account the same way.
 7. Transfer an NFT from one account to another.
 8. Use a script to see what NFTs are stored in each account's collection.
